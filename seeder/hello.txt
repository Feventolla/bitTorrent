Scenario: C no longer perceives any activity from C* – a halting
failure? Distinguishing between a crash or omission/timing failure
may be impossible:
Asynchronous system: no assumptions about process execution
speeds or message delivery times → cannot reliably detect crash
failures.
Synchronous system: process execution speeds and message delivery
times are bounded → we can reliably detect omission and timing
failures.
In practice we have partially synchronous systems: most of the time,
we can assume the system to be synchronous, yet there is no bound on
the time that a system is asynchronous → can normally reliably
detect crash failures.
